# Breast Cancer Classification Project

This repository contains code for classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 569 instances, each representing a tumor, with features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features include various measures such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

## Code

The main code for the breast cancer classification is implemented in `Breast Cancer Classification.ipynb`. 
This Jupyter Notebook contains the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loading the dataset and preprocessing the data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset and analyzing it.
3. Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features and transforming data for model training.
4. Model Training: Training machine learning model with Logistic Regression
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using various metrics such as accuracy_score.
6. Building Predictive System: Focuses on building a predictive system using machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign.

## Dependencies
